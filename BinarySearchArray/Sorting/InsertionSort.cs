        Worst case : O(n*n) (If it is present in descending order)

        Note: Internal sorting algorthim of array was implemented through Insertion Sort, Heap Sort and Quick Sort
        Insertion Sort in case of elements are less than 16
        Heap Sort in case of exceeds avg O(2 log n)
        Quick Sort in case of large elements
